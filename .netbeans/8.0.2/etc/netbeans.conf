# (http://wiki.netbeans.org/FaqWhatIsUserdir)
#
# On Windows ${DEFAULT_USERDIR_ROOT} will be replaced [...] (Edited by AG 2015-08-14)
#
# On other systems ${DEFAULT_USERDIR_ROOT} will be replaced by the launcher
# with "~/.netbeans" and ${DEFAULT_CACHEDIR_ROOT} with "~/.cache/netbeans"
#
# You can also use ${HOME} variable which will be replaced with
# user.home JVM system property value. This variable is valid only in
# netbeans_default_userdir and netbeans_default_cachedir properties.
#
# NOTE: If you specify a non-default userdir path on command line
# (--userdir option) and don't specify a cachedir path (--cachedir option),
# cachedir will be in "<userdir>/var/cache".
#
# Cachedir must be different from userdir. The same cachedir and userdir
# would cause problems.
#
netbeans_default_userdir="${DEFAULT_USERDIR_ROOT}/8.0.2"
netbeans_default_cachedir="${DEFAULT_CACHEDIR_ROOT}/8.0.2"

# Options used by NetBeans launcher by default:
# (can be overridden by explicit command line switches)
#
# Note that default -Xmx is selected for you automatically.
# You can find these values in var/log/messages.log file in your userdir.
# The automatically selected value can be overridden by specifying -J-Xmx
# here or on the command line.
#
# If you specify the heap size explicitly, you may also want to enable
# Concurrent Mark & Sweep garbage collector.

# AG 2015-08-14 importing options from older netbeans installations.
# Summary of most relevant options and descriptions follows: (See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/java.html)
#    -Xss: thread stack size. Default: 256 KB (Linux x86_64)
#    -Xms: initial and minimum Java heap size. Default: 25% of the amount of free physical memory in the system, up to 16 MB and at least 8 MB (-client mode)
#    -Xmx: maximum Java heap size. Default: 50% of available physical memory up to 2 GB (R27.3+, Linux x86_64)
#    # -XX:PermSize=size
#          This option was deprecated un JDK 8, and superseded by the -XX:MetaspaceSize option.
#          It was: Sets the space (in bytes) allocated to the permanent generation that triggers a garbage collection if it is exceeded.
#    # -XX:MaxPermSize=size
#          This option was deprecated in JDK 8, and superseded by the -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize option.
#          It was: Sets the maximum permanent generation space size (in bytes).
#    # -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize
#          Sets the maximum amount of native memory that can be allocated for class metadata. By default, the size is not limited. 
#    -Xverify: mode of the bytecode verifier. Bytecode verification helps to troubleshoot some problems, but it also adds overhead to the running application.
#          none: Do not verify the bytecode. This reduces startup time and also reduces the protection provided by Java.
#    -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
#          Enables the use of the CMS garbage collector for the old generation.
#          Oracle recommends that you use the CMS garbage collector when application latency requirements cannot be met by the throughput (-XX:+UseParallelGC) garbage collector. The G1 garbage collector (-XX:+UseG1GC) is another alternative.
#          AG 2015-08-14:
#              From internet research, it looks like the CMS (Concurrent Mark and Sweep) is much more efficient than the G1 collector. The latter having a slightly better latency.
#              The ParallelGC reaches the best performance at the cost of many "stop the world" (STW) pauses. Not what I want for my IDE
#    -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled
#          Enables class unloading when using the concurrent mark-sweep (CMS) garbage collector. This option is enabled by default.
#          AG 2015-08-14:
#              If false, java won't claim the memory reserved for the metadata of classes that aren't used anymore.
#              In cases where a lot of dynamic classes are created, this is a problem.
